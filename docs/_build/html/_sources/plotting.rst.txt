Plotting functions
=============================

For a rapid visualisation of the simulation results, few plotting functionalities comes with the package.

Three plotting methods are available: ``limit_cycle_2D``, ``limit_cycle_3D``, ``plot_multipliers``, ``plot_time_series``.

``limit_cycle_2D`` takes as argument the two state space variables to plot the limit cycle in a 2D phase space.

``limit_cycle_3D`` is analogous, but takes three variables, showing a 3D phase space.

``plot_multipliers`` takes as argument the array containing the Floquet multipliers
