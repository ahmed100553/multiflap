Welcome to multiflapp's documentation!
======================================

Multiflapp is a ``python`` toolbox optimised to assess the cycle stability of flapping fliers. The kernel of this framework relies on the **multiple-shooting** algorithm, which is a numerical method to detect iteratively limit cycles, and assess their stability via the Floquet multipliers.

The object-oriented structure of this code allows the user to couple the multiple-shooting scheme with any system of ordinary differential equations.

The documentation is organized as follows:
