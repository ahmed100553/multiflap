# multiflap

`multiflap` is a Python toolbox for finding periodic orbit of nonlinear systems
of ODEs. The code relies on the multiple-shooting algorithm, and simoultaneously allows to study the stability of the system via the Floquet multipliers.

This toolbox is optimised to study the limit cycle of flapping wings dynamics, but the modular architecture allows the user to use the kernel with any set of ODEs, changing an input file only.
