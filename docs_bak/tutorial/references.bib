@article{Wu:2003,
	Abstract = {In this paper we describe a physics-based method for synthesis of bird flight animations. Our method computes a realistic set of wingbeats that enables a bird to follow the specified trajectory. We model the bird as an articulated skeleton with elastically deformable feathers. The bird motion is created by applying joint torques and aerodynamic forces over time in a forward dynamics simulation. We solve for each wingbeat motion separately by optimizing for wingbeat parameters that create the most natural motion. The final animation is constructed by concatenating a series of optimal wingbeats. This detailed bird flight model enables us to produce flight motions of different birds performing a variety of maneuvers including taking off, cruising, rapidly descending, turning, and landing.},

	Abstract = {The avian wing possesses the ability to syn- chronize flexion or extension of the elbow and wrist joints automatically. Skeletal and muscular mechanisms are involved in generating this phenomenon. The "drawing-parallels" action of the radius and ulna coor- dinates the movements of the forearm with the carpus. Movement of the radius along the length of the forearm is not dependent on the shape disparity between the dorsal and ventral condyles of the humerus, nor is it generated by the shape of the dorsal condyle itself. In- stead, shifting of the radius toward the wrist occurs dur- ing humeroulnar flexion when the radius, being pushed by muscles toward the ulna, is deflected off the Incisura radialis toward the wrist. Movement of the radius to- ward the elbow occurs during the latter stages of humer- oulnar extension when, as the dorsal condyle of the humerus and the articular surface of the ulna's dorsal cup roll apart, the radius gets pulled by the humerus and its ligaments away from the wrist. Synchronization of the forearm with the manus is accomplished by two- joint muscles and tendons. M. extensor metacarpi radi- alis and the propatagial tendons act to extend the manus in unison with the forearm, while M. extensor metacarpi ulnaris helps these limb segments flex simulta- neously. M. flexor carpi ulnaris , in collaboration with the "drawing-parallels" mechanism, flexes the carpus automatically when the elbow is flexed, thereby circum- ducting the manus from the plane of the wing toward the body. In a living bird, these skeletal and muscular coordinating mechanisms may function to automate the internal kinematics of the wing during flapping flight. A mechanized wing may also greatly facilitate the initial
flight of fledgling birds. The coordinating mechanisms of the wing can be detected in a bird's osteology, thereby providing researchers with a new avenue by which to gauge the flight capabilities of avian fossil taxa.},

@article{Tobalske:1996,
	Abstract = {To investigate how birds that differ in morphology change their wing and body movements while flying at a range of speeds, we analyzed high-speed (60 Hz) video tapes of black-billed magpies (Pica pica) flying at speeds of 4--14 m s??1 and pigeons (Columba livia) flying at 6--20 m s??1 in a wind-tunnel. Pigeons had higher wing loading and higher-aspect-ratio wings compared with magpies. Both species alternated phases of steady-speed flight with phases of acceleration and deceleration, particularly at intermediate flight speeds. The birds modulated their wingbeat kinematics among these phases and frequently exhibited non-flapping phases while decelerating. Such modulation in kinematics during forward flight is typical of magpies but not of pigeons in the wild. The behavior of the pigeons may have been a response to the reduced power costs for flight in the closed wind-tunnel relative to those for free flight at similar speeds. During steady-speed flight, wingbeat frequency did not change appreciably with increasing flight speed. Body angle relative to the horizontal, the stroke-plane angles of the wingtip and wrist relative to the horizontal and the angle describing tail spread at mid-downstroke all decreased with increasing flight speed, thereby illustrating a shift in the dominant function of wing flapping from weight support at slow speeds to positive thrust at fast speeds. Using wingbeat kinematics to infer lift production, it appeared that magpies used a vortex-ring gait during steady-speed flight at all speeds whereas pigeons used a vortex-ring gait at 6 and 8ms??1, a transitional vortex-ring gait at 10ms??1, and a continuous-vortex gait at faster speeds. Both species used a vortex-ring gait for acceleration and a continuous- vortex gait or a non-flapping phase for deceleration during flight at intermediate wind-tunnel speeds. Pigeons progressively flexed their wings during glides as flight speed increased but never performed bounds. Wingspan during glides in magpies did not vary with flight speed, but the percentage of bounds among non-flapping intervals increased with speed from 10 to 14 m s??1. The use of non- flapping wing postures seemed to be related to the gaits used during flapping and to the aspect ratio of the wings. We develop an `adverse-scaling' hypothesis in which it is proposed that the ability to reduce metabolic and mechanical power output using flap-bounding flight at fast flight speeds is scaled negatively with body mass. This represents an alternative to the `fixed-gear' hypothesis previously suggested by other authors to explain the use of intermittent flight in birds. Future comparative studies in the field would be worthwhile, especially if instantaneous flight speeds and within-wingbeat kinematics were documented; new studies in the laboratory should involve simultaneous recording of wing kinematics and aerodynamic forces on the wing.},
